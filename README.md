# Lab Task 03 â€“ Array Operations in Java

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This project demonstrates the **implementation of array data structure operations** in Java using a **menu-driven program** with `switch-case`.

The key learning outcomes are:
        - Understanding how to work with arrays in Java.
        - Performing **insertion** and **deletion** by shifting elements.
- Traversing and displaying elements.
        - Implementing **linear search**.
        - Using a menu-driven program for interactive execution.

        ---

        ## ðŸ“Œ Features (Operations)
1. **Traversal**
        - Display all elements of the array.

        2. **Insertion**
        - Insert at the **beginning**.
        - Insert at a **given position** (user input).
        - Insert at the **end**.

        3. **Deletion**
        - Delete from the **beginning**.
        - Delete from a **given position** (user input).
        - Delete from the **end**.

        4. **Searching**
        - Linear Search (search for an element by value).

        5. **Exit**
        - End the program.
